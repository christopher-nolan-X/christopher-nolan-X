- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Chris, but I go by @christopher-nolan-X on Github. I enjoy doing magic tricks for the enjoyment of others and I believe that the boundaries of magic should be constantly pushed forward onto new heights. Are you watching closely? ðŸª„ (If you get this reference kudos to you!)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development, data visualization and data science. Hoping to work on building projects that help people make better decisions and/or help them understand the world better.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning full-stack web development with Nucamp with some backend Python on the side.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via my personal email at chris.hyatt7@gmail.com.
